ðŸŽ¯ ASSIGNMENT: Use Pydantic validators and computed fields

TASKS:
1. Create a Booking model with:
   - user_id: str
   - room_id: int
   - nights: int (must be â‰¥ 1)
   - rate_per_night: float

2. Use Field to enforce the constraint on nights.
3. Add a computed field called total_cost that multiplies nights Ã— rate_per_night.
4. Create an instance and print total_cost.
