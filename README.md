# 🚀 Pydantic Crash Course – Notes & Assignments

Welcome to my personal journey through **Pydantic** – a powerful Python library for **data validation**, **settings management**, and **type enforcement**. Widely used with frameworks like **FastAPI** and **Typer**.

This repository contains a **well-structured collection** of learning notes and hands-on assignments covering essential and advanced features of **Pydantic v2+**.

---

## 📘 What is Pydantic?

**Pydantic** is a data validation and parsing library that uses Python type hints. Define structured models with automatic type checking, default values, nested structures, and custom validation—all with **clear error messages**.

✨ **Key Benefits:**
- Type-safe data models
- Auto-validation of user input
- Easy JSON serialization/deserialization
- Seamless integration with FastAPI and other tools

## 📚 Course Contents

Each tutorial includes:
- ✅ **Notes File** (`XX_model_notes.py`) → Detailed code-based explanations
- 🧪 **Assignment File** (`XX_assignment.py`) → Hands-on practice with validation logic
